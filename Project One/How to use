This is some background on the program.

So my idea was to have a DND style game, however I quickly found I bit off way more than I could chew, so I dumbed down my program a lot... like its
actually comical some of the ideas I thought I could implement in "short" time.

Overall though, with the help of my prior programming knowledge, I was able to atleast put a good amount of my ideas into fruision.

It works like this...
A user is created with defaulted basic values for health points, attack, speed, and the number of health potions they have.
An enemy goblin (default enemy) will be created for the first "battle", 
You play the game by pressing the continue button to start, than to continue playing through a round
First a check for speed will happen to see who will attack first, than after that, whoever got attacked, will retaliate and attack back,
Subtracting HP for each respective health pool as needed

At the end of a battle, if a users health is 40 or below, they will automatically use one of their health potions, 
addedly the enemies items bonus will be given to the user (Another HP Pot, Increase speed or attack), and the round count will increase
The user will only be able to spawn another monster to play against, than the cycle repeats until the users health is at 0 or below.

I think theres something broken with it, for some reason, just a gut feeling.
